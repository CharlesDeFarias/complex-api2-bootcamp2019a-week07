# Discography & album info Generator
An expansion of an earlier API I used, now using two APIs from theAudioDB to generate a list of recent albums by an artist and then the user is able to click on one of the items on the list at a time to generate info about the clicked album.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

Really just used some basic HTML & CSS along with the ES6 I used after fetching the data from NASA.

## Optimizations
I'm having trouble getting the code to work fluidly, so there's some research I need to do there. Once that's done and this is functional, I want to be able to also generate a list of tracks for each clicked album.

## Lessons Learned:

Understanding 1 API does not mean you'll immediately understand how to immediately use another API from the same source :(
